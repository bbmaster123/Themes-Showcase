Welcome!

This repo is for showcasing theme ideas for Windows 11 shell components and apps. 
As I am working on my Damascus theme, I am also collecting gifs and images to create draft versions of various theme ideas. 

Some more ideas I've had, but haven't actually put together include:

- explosions when clicking on start
- kamehameha
- color shift
- animated glowing/pulsing/flickering effect

Anyone is welcome to submit ideas as well as assets for this showcase repo.
thanks for looking!
